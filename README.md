# Overview

A simple plugin to import recipes directly into Logseq just by using the URL of the recipe!

# Usage

Click on the plugin icon, key in the URL of the recipe page, and press 'Enter'! Some recipe pages are not supported. For example, if you search for a recipe in Google, and the recipes that are previewed should work. Those that do not have a preview may not.

Also, because every site tends to format their recipes in slightly different ways, hence there may be recipes that are not imported correctly or are not able to be imported at all, even when there is a Google preview. Do file an issue if you come across such a site.

# Installation

If not available from the marketplace, please [download the release](https://github.com/hkgnp/logseq-recipeimporter-plugin/releases) and load it manually into Logseq.
