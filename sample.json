I used about 10 oz of pasta, subbed a 14.5 oz can of fire roasted tomatoes (drained) for 1 of the fresh tomatoes, and subbed a 14.5 oz can of Italian stewed tomatoes (which I pureed) for the 8 oz of crushed tomatoes. I only used 1 Tbsp of oil total and also added in a can of mushrooms. I doubled the lemon juice, added a little cracked pepper and some red pepper flakes for a kick. Not a fan of mussels, so I used only shrimp, about 1.5 pounds.   We sprinkled fresh parm and fresh chopped basil on top.  It was really easy to make, flavorful and healthy!",

I used vegetable oil rather than olive oil because I was out.  I did not use vinegar.  I added a lot of black pepper, salt, oregano, & some sugar.  I used raw scallops and let those simmer in the sauce.  I used pre-cooked mussels & shrimp which I added near the end just to heat through.  I did not measure anything.  My sauce was pretty running, I think because of the seafood I used & how it had been packaged.  I used most of a 12oz can of tomato paste to thicken the sauce.  This was fabulous!!",

            "reviewBody": "Made this with only slight modifications to fit our pantry - chopped one large tomato, then drained and used a can of diced to take the place of the second; also let it cook down a bit more than the recipe before adding the seafood.  All in all, a great recipe we will make again.  Thanks!",
